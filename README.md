# Cryptocurrencies
- For this project, we analyzed cryptocurrency data in order to find meaningful insights on what cryptocurrencies to offer to customers for an investment portfolio. First, we preprocessed cryptocurrency data to find which cryptocurrencies were available on the trading market. Next, we performed PCA on the cleaned dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the data to three principal components. Afterwards, we performed Unsupervised Machine Learning using the K-Means Algorithm to cluster the cryptocurrencies into four different classes. Finally, we visualized the data by creating a table containing the tradable cryptocurrencies and plotted the data, by class, with Total Coins Mined on the x-axis and Total Coin Supply on the y-axis using a scatter plot.
